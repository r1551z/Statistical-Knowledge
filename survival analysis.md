# Intro
Survival analysis related knowledge.

# Survival function, hazard function and density function

In this section we will have a brief introduction, about distribution related
functions for survival analysis.

## Definition
In survival analysis, we view survival time T as a random variable, and we use
the following four functions to describe it.

cumulative distribution function: $F(t) = P(T < t)$
probability density function: $\def$
